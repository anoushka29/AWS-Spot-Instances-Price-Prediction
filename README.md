This project focuses on developing a predictive application to forecast AWS Spot Instance prices, enabling efficient cloud cost management. Leveraging Apache Spark, it processes over 1 million data points per region and utilizes advanced regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. By analyzing factors such as datetime, region, operating system, and instance type, the model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 6.23%. Visualizations created with Matplotlib and Plotly provide actionable insights and trends, supporting real-time resource allocation and cost optimization.
